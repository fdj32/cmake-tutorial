sudo apt install cmake-qt-gui

Why methods in <math.h> can't be found? while the method "atof" can be found and file "math.h" can also be found?

The next step is to build the project in the usual manner and then run CPack on it. To build a binary distribution you would run:

cpack --config CPackConfig.cmake

To create a source distribution you would type

cpack --config CPackSourceConfig.cmake
